	<p>
		I'm a Java developer with more than seven years of experience building secure and scalable
		services for enterprise clients. At DataArt I help craft solutions for Legal &amp; General, one
		of the UK's largest financial services companies.
	</p>

	<p>
		Last year I completed EPAM's advanced solution architecture program, deepening my knowledge of
		cloud platforms and modern microservice design.
	</p>

	<p>
		A career highlight was leading the creation of a highâ€‘load messaging platform capable of
		processing billions of events every month.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm always interested in challenging freelance work and consulting engagements where I can apply
		my expertise to improve system performance and reliability.
